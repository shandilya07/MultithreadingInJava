||=======================||
|| CONCURRENT COLLECTIONS||
||=======================||

|> Most of the Java collections are not thread safe
|> Ways to make collections thread safe
   => Use Collections.synchronize() method
   => Use the concurrent collections which are synchronized

|> Downsides of using the Collections.synchronized() approach
   => Coarse grained locking
   => Limited functionality
   => No Fail Fast Iterators
   => Performance Overhead

|> Introduction to Blocking Queue
   > Blocking Queue Interfaces
     => BlockingQueue
        >> BlockingDeque
        >> TransferQueue

   > Major implementations
     => ArrayBlockingQueue
     => LinkedBlockingQueue
     => PriorityBlockingQueue
     => DelayQueue
     => SynchronousQueue

   > Blocking Queue Operations
     => put(E e)
     => take()
     => offer(E e)
     => poll()
     => peek()
